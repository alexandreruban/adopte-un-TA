  - title: Improving CSS
    description: >
        In case you're unaware, CSS by itself is not very dynamic. There's no
        support for variables and functions, and dealing with vendor prefixes
        can be a nightmare! In this course, Improving CSS with Stylus, you'll
        learn how Stylus solves all of this and more. You can declare variables,
        functions, mixins, and even improve the visibility of your CSS without
        having to include colons, semi-colons, and braces. First, you're going
        to learn how to integrate Stylus within your development environment.
        Then, you will take a close look at Stylus from a beginner's level all
        the way up to an advanced level. Finally, you will create your very own
        project so that you can gain meaningful experience by using Stylus. After
        watching this course, you'll be ready to starting using Stylus to improve
        your workflow.

  - title: A Better CSS (LESS and SASS)
    description: >
        CSS is a great way to separate your design and markup during HTML development,
        but there are key pain points that make it more difficult than it should be.
        Dynamic stylesheet languages like LESS and SASS can make style sheets more
        readable, maintainable, and easier to write. This course dives into both LESS
        and SASS and shows you how powerful these languages can be.

  - title: Designing Schema for Elasticsearch
    description: >
        You can get better search results beyond the basic out-of-the-box search
        experience with Elasticsearch. In this course, Designing Schema for
        Elasticsearch, you will learn how to configure indexes to get more nuanced
        d meaningful search results. First, you will use dynamic and explicit mapping
        hich allows you to specify field types within your document, which in turn
        determines how they are indexed and searched. Next, you will learn how you can
        map relationships and hierarchies from the traditional RDBMS world to the flat
        orld of Elasticsearch. Finally, you will see Elasticsearch's special features,
        working with geospatial data such as GPS, and time-based data such as log files,
        and also aliasing indices to share them across multiple users for a better
        search experience. At the end of this course, you will have hands-on experience
        signing your Elasticsearch indexes and mappings to work well with different
        kinds of data, such as hierarchical, geospatial, or time-based data.
